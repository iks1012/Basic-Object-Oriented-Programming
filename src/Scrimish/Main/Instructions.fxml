Both players have a set of cards composed of the following cards:&#10;&#10;#1 Dagger Cards (x5 per player); #2 Sword Cards (x5 per player); #3 Morning Star Cards (x3 per player); #4 War Axe Cards (x3 per player); &#10;#5 Halberd Cards (x2 per player); #6 Longsword Cards (x2 per player); Archer Cards (x2 per player); Shield Cards (x2 per player); Crown Card (x1 per player)&#10;&#10;Setup: The user player places 5 Piles of 5 Cards each face down in front of him. The Crown Card should be hidden on the bottom of one of the 5 Piles. &#10;The rest of the Cards may be arranged however you like. The computer does the same thing: the crown card is placed on the bottom of a random pile,&#10; while the rest of the card are distributed into 5 piles (such that we have 5 cards in each pile).&#10;&#10;Game Play: The players take turns attacking (starting with the user first) by selecting the top card from one of their piles and laying that card face up&#10;in front of one of their opponent's piles. The defending player must then reveal the top card of the pile that was attacked. The card with the lowest&#10;number value loses and is discarded. The winning card must be returned face down to the top of the original pile it was drawn from. If the two cards&#10;have the same number value, both cards are discarded. The play continues until one of the players attacks their opponent's Crown Card, winning the game.&#10;&#10;Archer Card: If you attack with an Archer Card, it always wins. If your Archer Card is attacked, it always loses.&#10;Shield Card: Shield Cards cannot be used to attack. If your Shield Card is attacked, both your Shield Card and your opponent's attacking Card are discarded&#10;(except for Archer Cards: If a Shield Card is attacked by an Archer Card, neither Card is discarded, and both are returned face down to their original Piles).&#10;Crown Card: You can attack with your Crown Card. If you attack your opponent's Crown Card, you win. Otherwise, you lose the game.&#10;Instead of attacking, you may intentionally discard one Card on your turn. You do not have to reveal that Card to your opponent.&#10;You cannot intentionally discard your Crown Card.&#10;&#10;">
